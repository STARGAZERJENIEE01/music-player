Like no matter where I went or who I was with, something was always missing. I smiled, I laughed, but deep down, I felt like a piece that didnâ€™t quite fit. But then you came into my life. And suddenly, everything made sense. Your presence felt like homeâ€”warm, safe, real. Now I know where I belong. Not in a place, not in a crowd, but with you. I belong to your heart, to your laughter, to the quiet moments we share. With you, I finally feel complete. With you, Iâ€™ve found where Iâ€™m meant to be. I belong to you." },

You feel like the universeâ€™s most beautiful secret â€” written in the stars just for me. With you, everything feels lighter, like Iâ€™m floating among constellations made of our memories. Youâ€™re the calm in my chaos, the moon to my tides, and the brightest star in my galaxy. I donâ€™t need a shooting star to wish on anymoreâ€¦ because youâ€™re already my wish come true. âœ¨ðŸŒ™ðŸ’«" },
      { title: "sacrifice - enhypen", img: "assets/img26.jpg", audio: "assets/song26.mp3", lyric: "Itâ€™s the little sacrifices you make every day â€” like giving up your time just to talk to me, staying up a little later when youâ€™re tired, or choosing to listen when you have a million other things on your mind â€” that show me how deeply you care. Those small, quiet moments add up to something huge. They build a love that feels real, steady, and unshakeable. I notice every one of them, even the ones you think go unseen, and they make me love you more than words can say..... You make me feel safe, chosen, and cherished â€” and I hope you always feel that from me too." },

Through the quiet days and the chaotic ones, through every laugh and every tearâ€”Iâ€™m not going anywhere. No matter what life throws at us, Iâ€™ll be standing by your side, always. Sometimes the world moves too fast, and everything feels uncertain, but my love for you is the one thing that never changes. You donâ€™t have to face anything alone. If your heart ever feels heavy, Iâ€™ll be the arms you can fall into. If your smile fades, Iâ€™ll be the reason it comes back. You donâ€™t even have to say a wordâ€”Iâ€™ll know, and Iâ€™ll stay. You mean more to me than you probably realize. And if you ever wonder where I am, or how I feelâ€”just remember this: Iâ€™m right here, loving you, endlessly. Always yours, -jeniee" },
